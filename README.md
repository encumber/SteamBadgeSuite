## TODO
There might be bugs as this is a large userscript if there are please let me know what they are so that I can work on fixing them when i have time, I currently work 2 jobs while mentoring a robotics team so I don't have much time but if I know what needs to be fixed I can try my hardest to squeeze some time in somewhere in order to fix things, you can leave them in the issues page here, or adding me on discord/steam and letting me know there - do note that if your profile on steam looks sketchy I might not accept your friend req but my comments are open.

## Contact
feel free to add me on discord io7 or add me on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/client)

if you want to support me the best ways are either by sending me a [Trade Offer](https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=1053762784&token=sjVuSqZ0) on steam or by adding me and asking for a crypto address, any money that I get from this will go towards the robotics team that I mentor as that is where I find the most enjoyment in life currently.
